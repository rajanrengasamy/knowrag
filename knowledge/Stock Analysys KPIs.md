## 1. Valuation (is it cheap or expensive?)

Key metrics used across stocks:[3][4][5]

- Price to earnings (P/E) and forward P/E  
- Price to book (P/B)  
- Price to sales (P/S)  
- Price to free cash flow (P/FCF)  
- PEG ratio (P/E divided by earnings growth)  
- Discounted cash flow (DCF) / Fair value vs current price  
- Simply Wall St “Fair Ratio” and valuation checks (e.g., undervalued vs peers/market)[5][6]

What they mean / why they matter:

- **P/E, P/B, P/S, P/FCF** compare price to fundamentals (earnings, assets, sales, cash); they show how much you are paying for each dollar of business output.[4][5]
- **PEG** adjusts P/E for expected growth; helps avoid paying growth‑stock multiples for no-growth businesses.[5]
- **DCF / Fair value** models the present value of future cash flows; the “discount/premium to fair value” is central for value‑oriented trading setups.[6][5]

As a trader using fundamentals, valuation tells you whether positive/negative stories are already priced in and how much “re‑rating room” exists.

## 2. Future growth (what is the market expecting?)

Core metrics used for any stock:[7][3][4]

- Forecast revenue growth (1–3+ years)  
- Forecast earnings (EPS) growth  
- Forecast free cash flow growth  
- Future return on equity (future ROE check)[7]
- Analyst target prices / future margin expectations  

Meaning / why they matter:

- Growth estimates show the earnings/revenue path the market is implicitly trading; actual results vs these expectations drive a lot of price action.[4][7]
- **Future ROE** tells you whether the business is expected to earn high returns on capital going forward, not just in the past.[7]

For trading, strong forecast growth plus low valuation can be a powerful long bias; high expectations plus rich valuation can be a “disappointment risk” scenario.

## 3. Past performance (has it executed well?)

Key metrics Simply Wall St tracks for any company:[8][3]

- Historical earnings growth (1, 3, 5‑year CAGR)  
- Historical revenue growth  
- Return on equity (ROE)  
- Return on assets (ROA)  
- Net profit margin and margin trend  

Meaning / why they matter:

- **Earnings and revenue growth** history shows whether the company is consistently compounding or lumpy/cyclical.[8]
- **ROE/ROA** show how efficiently management uses capital and assets; high, stable ROE is a hallmark of quality.[8]
- **Net margin** indicates pricing power and cost control; rising margins often precede or justify re‑ratings.[8]

For traders, strong past performance provides a base case for why the market might keep rewarding a stock, while deteriorating trends warn of potential deratings or breaks in long‑term trends.

## 4. Financial health (can it survive shocks?)

Across all sectors, the Financial Health section focuses on the balance sheet and liquidity:[9][4]

- Total debt vs equity (D/E)  
- Debt to free cash flow or debt to EBITDA  
- Short‑term vs long‑term liabilities  
- Cash and cash equivalents; “cash runway” (how long cash covers operations)[9][4]
- Interest coverage (EBIT / interest expense)  

Meaning / why they matter:

- Leverage and coverage ratios show how vulnerable the business is to downturns or rate changes.[9]
- Cash runway and liquidity determine whether a company might need dilutive capital raises in tough periods.[4][9]

In trading terms, weak balance sheets increase tail risk (sudden collapses, equity raises), while strong ones justify staying through volatility or buying dips.

## 5. Dividend (what income and how safe?)

Applied to any dividend‑paying stock:[2][3][4]

- Dividend yield (trailing and forward)  
- Payout ratio (dividends / earnings, or dividends / FCF)  
- Dividend growth history  
- Dividend stability checks vs earnings and cash flow  

Meaning / why they matter:

- Yield contributes to total return and can attract yield‑focused flows.[4]
- Payout ratio and coverage indicate sustainability; very high payouts with weak cash flow can precede cuts.[2][3]
- Growth/stability history shows whether dividends survive cycles or get cut at the first sign of stress.[4][8]

For traders, sustainable high yield can act as a “floor,” whereas an at‑risk dividend is a catalyst zone (cuts often create sharp, tradeable moves).

## 6. Management (who is running it?)

For any stock, the Management section checks:[10][2]

- CEO and management tenure and background  
- Average board tenure and independence  
- Age profile of executives and directors  
- CEO compensation level and structure vs peers and performance  
- Qualitative “management checks” (e.g., have they created shareholder value over time)[10]

Why this matters:

- Experienced, aligned management is more likely to allocate capital well and maintain margins/returns.[10]
- Poor alignment (excessive pay, weak track record) raises risk of value destruction even in a good industry.  

From a trading perspective, governance and leadership often show up in how the business handles shocks and whether it consistently surprises on results.

## 7. Ownership (who else is in the trade?)

Ownership analysis works the same across all sectors:[2][10][4]

- Institutional vs retail ownership percentages  
- Top shareholders (funds, strategic investors)  
- Insider ownership  
- Insider buying/selling behaviour and patterns[10]

Why it matters:

- High institutional ownership usually means better liquidity and more analyst coverage, but also higher correlation with index and factor flows.[4]
- Insider buying can be a positive signal; concentrated insider or founder stakes can align incentives but reduce free‑float.[10]

For traders, ownership structure influences liquidity, volatility and how news is absorbed (e.g., crowded institutional longs can unwind violently).

## 8. Company information (context & comparability)

This section gives neutral context for any stock:[1][4]

- Ticker, exchange, currency  
- Sector, industry, market and country  
- Market cap and share count  
- Headquarters, founding date, number of employees  

Why it matters:

- Sector/industry tags help you compare the stock’s metrics to peers and understand macro drivers.[4]
- Market cap and listing details affect liquidity, spread, and which funds or indices can hold it.[4]

As a fundamental trader, this is your starting point for peer‑screening and deciding which metrics are most relevant (e.g., SaaS vs utilities).

## 9. News & narrative (what’s moving it now?)

While not part of the Snowflake, Simply Wall St links company‑specific news and commentary for any stock.[6][4]

- Recent results commentary and valuation articles  
- Analyst upgrades/downgrades and new targets  
- Macro/sector pieces that affect the company’s theme  

Why it matters:

- Fundamentals change slowly, but narrative and flows move fast; news explains why price diverges from “fair value” in the short run.[6][4]
- Combining news with the eight core sections lets you separate short‑term noise from genuine, thesis‑changing events.
